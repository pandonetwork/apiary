# Apiary App

> A continuous funding app for [Aragon](https://www.aragon.org) DAOs

## Background

This app is a PoC experimenting continuous funding for Aragon DAOs.

You can read more about Apiary's rationale [here](https://github.com/1Hive/Apiary) and the relationship between the Bancor formula used in this PoC and the bonding curve price formula [here](https://medium.com/@billyrennekamp/converting-between-bancor-and-bonding-curve-price-formulas-9c11309062f5).

This app is a PoC in a very early alpha stage: do **NOT** use on mainnet for now.
